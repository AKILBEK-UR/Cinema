DESCRIPTION
This project is a movie application created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It allows users to search for movies by query, as well as view them through filters (Top 10 Expected, Premieres, Releases, and Favorites).

FEATURES:
- The movie poster should include: movie rating, poster (image), title, genres, and year.
- Display movies by categories: Current month premieres (first 10), Top expected movies (first 10), Top best movies (first 10), digital releases of the current month (first 10), and favorites.
- Add the ability to save movies to favorites by adding a heart button next to the movie title (working with localStorage).
  - When the heart button is clicked, it turns red and the movie is saved to localStorage.
  - When the heart button of a favorite movie is clicked, it turns white and the movie is removed from localStorage.
  - Favorite movies should be stored in a separate "Favorites" section alongside the other described sections.
  - Hearts should remain red even after the page is reloaded.
- Retrieve movies by search query and display them on the page.
